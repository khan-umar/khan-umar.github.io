Building My Portfolio Website :khan-umar.github.io

Creating khan-umar.github.io was an assignment aimed at showcasing my skills, projects, and services as a frontend developer. The process taught me a lot about structuring web content, designing clean user interfaces, and deploying a site for public access.

1.	Planning & Vision

I started with a clear idea: I wanted a simple, modern, and responsive personal portfolio. The main goals were to:

•	Introduce myself professionally

•	Display my technical skills

•	Showcase some of the projects I’ve worked on

•	Provide easy contact options

I mapped out the sections I needed: Home, About, Skills, Services, Projects, and Contact. This gave me a structure to build around.

2.	Coding the Website

•	HTML

I used semantic HTML5 to build the backbone of each section. Each part of the page—headers, footers, main content, navigation—was carefully organized to make the site accessible and easy to maintain.

•	CSS

For styling, I wrote custom CSS. I kept the design clean and modern, using a consistent colour palette and typography. I paid special attention to responsiveness, making sure the layout adapted to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes using media queries and flexible units.

•	JavaScript

I added some interactivity using vanilla JavaScript—for things like animations, form behaviour, and small dynamic elements (like interactive project cards or alerts).

3.	Content & Design Choices

I included an About section with a brief introduction and a Skills section listing technologies I’m confident in—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, Firebase, Node.js, and some design tools like Figma and Photoshop.

In the Projects section, I added links and descriptions for tools I’ve built which included an age calculator, stopwatch, and dice roll app. These small projects represent my learning path and problem-solving mind-set.

The Services section outlines what I offer (frontend development, UI/UX design, etc.), while the Contact section includes a form and my basic contact info.

4.	Hosting with GitHub Pages

After thorough testing and refinement, I deployed the website using GitHub Pages.  This involved pushing the code to a GitHub repository and configuring the repository settings to serve the site from the main branch. 

Conclusion

Developing khan-umar.github.io was a fulfilling project that allowed me to consolidate my skills and present my professional profile effectively.  It stands as a testament to my dedication to web development and design.
